Overview:
    The program scans your inbound network directory for messages
    which contain a keyword and moves them to another directory.

ErrorLevel Values:

        No_Problem              0

    The program did everything without a problem.

        Cant_Find_Config_File   10

    The configuration file couldn't be found.  The environment
    variable "SEC-TOSS" can be created to point to the path and the
    file name.  If no environment variable is set, the program
    looks in the default directory.

        Cant_Open_File          11

    A message file (*.MSG) in the network directory couldn't be
    opened for some reason.

        Configuration_Bad       12

    The configuration file is missing something.

        Cant_Create_Message     13

    A message file can't be created in the destination directory.  The
    most common reasons are because the directory doesn't exist or
    there is no disk space remaining.

        Cant_Write_Message      14

    A message file can't be written to the destination directory.  The
    most common reasons are because the directory doesn't exist or
    there is no disk space remaining.

Configuration:

        net-directory { path }

    Tells the program what your inbound network mail directory is.

        dest-directory { path }

    Tells the program where to move messages to.

        keyword { keyword(s) }

    Tells the program what keyword or phrase to search for.  For the
    secular humanist mailing list, the keyword is 'SECHUM'.
